 - check all parameters with is[alpha|number]
 - increase hostname detection for the Via line
 - endless randtrash mode with logfile
 - support for IPv6
 - DNS SRV support
 - timeouts for usrloc
 - case in-sensitive
 - TCP support
 - RR support

Feel free to send me patches for this (or other) features!
